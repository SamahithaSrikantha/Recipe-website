            <h1>to Make Samosa
            </h1>
                <p>

                    
                    Below is my complete step-by-step guide with photos for making the best Punjabi Samosa recipe from scratch.
                    You start by making the savory filling and pastry dough. Then assemble the Aloo Samosa, fry, and enjoy with your favorite dipping sauces and chutneys!
                    
                </p>
                 <h2>   Cook the Veggies</h2>
                 <p>                    1. The first step is to cook the potatoes and peas for the savory and spiced filling.
                
                To cook the potatoes and peas in a stovetop pressure cooker: Place 3 medium-sized whole potatoes (300 to 450 grams) and 2 to 2.5 cups water in a 3 or 4 litre pressure cooker. On top of the potatoes carefully set a small trivet and pressure cooker-safe bowl with ½ cup green peas. Pressure cook for 5 to 6 whistles or 7 to 8 minutes on medium to medium-high flame.
                
                If using an Instant Pot: Place 3 medium-sized whole potatoes in the steel insert of a 6 quart IP. Add 2 cups water. Place a trivet on top of the potatoes, and on top of the trivet set a bowl with ½ cup of green peas. Pressure cook on high for 20 to 25 minutes.

            <p>
                2. For the stovetop pressure cooker, remove the lid after all the pressure falls in the cooker.
                
                For the Instant Pot, do a quick pressure release after 5 to 7 minutes. Check with a knife or fork to see if the potatoes are cooked well.
                
                The knife or fork should be able to slide through easily if the potatoes are cooked properly.
                
                If the potatoes are undercooked, then cook them for a few more minutes using the pressure cook function. Once done, drain the potatoes and peas in a colander and set aside to cool.

                Roast and Powder Spices
                3. Next, roast or toast the spices. This will help to release their flavors and should not be skipped!
                
                To a small frying pan over low heat add the following spices:
            </p>
            <p> 
                ½ inch cinnamon stick
                1 clove, optional
                1 green cardamom
                3 black peppercorns
                
                ½ teaspoon cumin seeds
                ½ teaspoon fennel seeds
                2 teaspoons coriander seeds
                Heat the spices for just a few minutes until aromatic, being careful to not burn.

                4. Remove the spices from the heat and allow to cool completely. Then, put them in a spice grinder or small mixer-grinder jar.

                5. Grind the toasted spices to a semi-fine powder, and set aside.
                
                
                Tip: If you are pressed for time to roast and grind the spices, then I have a solution for you.
                
                Mix 2 teaspoons ground coriander (coriander powder), ½ teaspoon ground cumin (cumin powder), ½ teaspoon ground fennel (fennel powder) and ½ teaspoon garam masala powder in a small bowl.
                
                Add this prepared spice mix at step 9 when the green peas and remaining ground spices are added.
                
                semi-finely ground spices
                
                Make Potato Stuffing
                6. Peel the skin off of the cooked potatoes, and chop them in ½ to 1 inch cubes.

                7. In a small skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil. When the oil becomes medium hot then reduce the heat to low.
                
                Crackle ½ teaspoon cumin seeds until fragrant. I used mustard oil as it really adds a punch in the stuffing.
                
                You can use neutral oil like sunflower oil, safflower oil, grapeseed oil or canola oil.

                8. Keep the heat on low and add 1 teaspoon finely chopped or minced ginger and 2 teaspoons finely chopped green chillies. Sauté for a few seconds until the raw aroma of ginger goes away.

                9. Now you can switch off the flame or keep flame to a low. Then add the cooked green peas, ½ teaspoon red chilli powder, 1 pinch of asafoetida (hing), the dry ground spice mix that we made and 1 to 2 teaspoons dry mango powder (amchur).
                
                The mango powder is what gives the Punjabi Samosa filling its signature tangy flavor that balances so well with the savory, spicy flavors of the other stuffing ingredients.
                
                green peas, spice powders added in the pan
                10. Stir together and sauté for a minute. You can add less or more dry mango powder depending upon personal taste.
                
                I added 2 teaspoons as just 1 teaspoon was not quite enough sour flavor for me.
                
                spices and peas mixed very well 
                11. Next add potato cubes, salt as required and 1 tablespoon chopped coriander leaves (also known as cilantro) to the skillet.
